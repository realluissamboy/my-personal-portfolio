        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, and thank you for stopping by to get to know me a little better!
        </p>
        <h2>🚀 Professionally Speaking…</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a dedicated Full Stack Software Engineer, specializing in web application development. My portfolio
            showcases a
            myriad of projects, reflecting a wealth of experience gleaned from working with some of the world’s renowned
            companies
            like Verizon, Zillow, and the New York Times.</p>
        <h2>👨‍👩‍👧 A Peek into My Personal World…
        </h2>
        <p>
            Off the tech scene, I'm a devoted husband and father. My journey has been diverse and enriching, from
            serving in the
            United States Marine Corps to navigating B2B sales for major corporations. These varied experiences not only
            make me
            versatile but also equip me with insights into the diverse challenges you might be encountering.</p>
        <h2>✈️ Wanderlust at Heart…
        </h2>
        <p>
            My love for traveling has taken me to over a dozen countries, entailed adventures like hitchhiking from
            Paris to
            Marrakech, and even involved living in Airbnbs throughout the US for over two years. Every journey has been
            a chapter,
            adding to my story and expanding my worldview.</p>

        <h2>🎓 Educational and Professional Credentials…
        </h2>
        <p>
            I hold a BS in Business Administration from Berkeley College, NYC, and a Certificate in Software Engineering
            from
            Fullstack Academy. I’ve also earned real estate sales licenses in three states, weaving a rich tapestry of
            skills and
            knowledge that I bring to my work.</p>
        <h2>📍 Home and Heart in San Diego...
        </h2>
        <p>
            Although San Diego is my base, you’ll often find me in New York City, immersing myself in its vibrant
            energy. When I'm
            not on the move, I’m cheering for my favorite teams - the New York Jets and the San Diego Padres, keeping
            the spirit of
            both coasts alive!
